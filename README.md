# 🚀 AI-Native React + Express Full-Stack Project

This is a full-stack web application built with **React (frontend)** and **Express.js (backend)**, crafted as part of my learning journey into react library. What makes this project unique is that it embraces an **AI-native approach** – using tools like GitHub Copilot not just for speed, but for deeper architectural learning.
